You are the Sun God, tasked with looking over your universe of stars. Over the millennia, you have watched as your stars live, thrive and die – either turning into white masses that leaves specks of dust or dark dangerous black holes that overtakes light. Now, guide each star as they grow within your universe, and be sure to keep them safe from turning into black holes!

Note: This game was created for Ludum Dare Discord Jam 8. The theme for the game jam was “Decay”.
